# Lab: CI/CD Pipeline with GitLab and Jenkins

This lab creates a new tenant with basic network objects and applications inside the ACI
fabric using Ansible.

At the end of this lab, you should have a functioning pipeline with a prompted deployment
after successful completion of the build and test stages.
